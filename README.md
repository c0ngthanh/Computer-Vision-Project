# Computer-Vision-Project
Project about Gradient Domain Processing 
You can modify another image and parameter in run function in any file to see the results
Analyze about time for calculation of all files:
PoissonBlending: 8s
MixingGradient: 170s
LaplacianPyramidBlending: 10s
PoissonColor2Gray: 3s
PoissonSharpening: 120s
PoissonColorTransfer: 210s
So dont worry, it'll take a little time. Just wait.
